# Quickmeet

A Flutter App to create and schedule meetings instantly.

## Aim

This project is aimed to allow people create meetings instantly from a simple interface and invite others by sharing ics file over social platforms.

## Working

User is expected to get authenticated using Google and permit the app to access their calendar. 

After this one time process, users can quickly create & schedule a meeting using the app. 

Once the meeting is scheduled it will be added to the creator's calendar and opens a share menu to invite other people using ics file.

## Technologies

This project is built using Flutter and uses Google's oauth packages + Firebase to authenticate user. 

For interacting with calendar, the project uses Google Calendar APIs v3 using the **googleapis_auth** dart package.
